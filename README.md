# Apocapatrol (prototype 0.1.0)

BepInEx 5 plugin for **Apocalypter** — groundwork for AI-driven raider cars. Right now it is a debug builder:
press `SpawnKey` (F7) in game and a complete car is assembled in front of you with the game's own part-attach recipe.

Default build: **PipeRat** frame, 4 × `small_wheel_1`, `1.2L I4 59HP 87Nm Gasoline` engine, `radiator_small`, `steeringwheel_7`.
Every part is configurable by prefab name or in-game item name (`[Build]`; edit live in the Apocasetter Mods menu).

What happens on the key:
1. The frame prefab is instantiated `SpawnDistance` m ahead, named and registered like a vanilla spawn (`ArrayList_Cars`).
2. Each part is instantiated at its hinge (`hinge_wheel_FL/FR/RL/RR`, `hinge_engine`, `hinge_radiator`, `hinge_steeringwheel`) and attached
   exactly like the game's `vehPart_Attach` FSM does: Rigidbody destroyed, tag `vehPart`, layer 8, parented with local pos/rot reset;
   parts are registered in `ArrayList_Items` so the car saves like a player-built one.
3. `FillFuel`: the tank (`Fuel/LiquidAmount`) is filled to capacity.
4. `StartEngine`: the frame's `START` key FSM is stepped through `Ignition` → `Start`; if NWH reports the engine not running after 3 s,
   `NwhStartFallback` calls `powertrain.engine.StartEngine()` directly.
5. `DriveTestSeconds` > 0: throttle is pushed with nobody inside — checks that the NWH vehicle drives without a player (needed for AI cars).

Everything is logged to `BepInEx\LogOutput.log` (`VerboseLog` adds prefab lookups, hinge FSM states, speeds).

Build: `build.sh` (mcs against the game's `Managed` + `BepInEx\core`) or `dotnet build` (deploys to `BepInEx\plugins`).
